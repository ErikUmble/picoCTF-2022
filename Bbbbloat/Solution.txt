I used objdump to look at the assembly (since gdb didn't recognize the obfuscation).
	objdump -M intel -d bbbbloat | grep scan
pointed out where the scanf was being called.
then I just looked and shortly after it was called there was a
	cmp eax, 0x86187
	jne, ...
so I just tried entering 549255 as favorite number. and it worked.
