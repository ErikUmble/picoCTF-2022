I first used gdb to get the target address for win, which is 0x080491f6
Then, seeing as the buffer is size 32, I used an input of 
"a"*32 + "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
then since the function returned to 0x70...6d, I knew that there were 12 bytes
beyond the 32 byte buffer until the bytes for the return address began 
(since a is 0x61 and 0x6d - 0x61 = 11)
So I used pwn to send 
"a".encode('utf-8')*(32+12) + p32(0x080491f6) 
to the server, which then gave me the flag.
