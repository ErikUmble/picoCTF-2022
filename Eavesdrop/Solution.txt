I opened the packet file in wireshark, and followed the first TCP stream, 
which gave me this conversation

Hey, how do you decrypt this file again?
You're serious?
Yeah, I'm serious
*sigh* openssl des3 -d -salt -in file.des3 -out file.txt -k supersecretpassword123
Ok, great, thanks.
Let's use Discord next time, it's more secure.
C'mon, no one knows we use this program like this!
Whatever.
Hey.
Yeah?
Could you transfer the file to me again?
Oh great. Ok, over 9002?
Yeah, listening.
Sent it
Got it.
You're unbelievable

I then found this:
Salted__}..O.G....^..GZ	LbvbJ5eYm...R...,@.M.U..
on another tcp stream, going to 9002

I copied that string and echoed it into a file to then decrypt.
I tried using the decrypt command given in the conversation, but it kept saying "bad decrypt"
and not working. After opening the file that I had the encrypted message in, I realized the
copying had removed some of the data, which was probably causing the problem.
So in wireshark, I followed the stream again, and saved the data to salt_flag.des3 and tried
again. Same problem occured.
Finally, I realized I needed to switch content type to raw (from ASCII) in the wireshark
stream follow. I tried again with the new file and it worked.
