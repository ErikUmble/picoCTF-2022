With 
	fls -r disk.img -o 206848 | grep key
I found a bunch of potential key files. 
I tried the ssh_host_rsa_key.pub with
	icat disk.img -o 206848 22 > key_file
and then running the ssh command
but I do not know what the password is, to enter on the shh prompt.
I looked for password files on the disk, but could not find anything useful
in any of them.
There are other ssh_host public key files, which could be worth trying,
but it seems like no matter what, I'm asked for a password after ssh command,
so I think we need to figure out what the password is.

Ok, I think it should be possible to use the public key instead of the password,
but nothing I've tried so far has worked. It might be necessary to try each of 
the various ssh_host keys available on the disk. I also might not have 
authorized_keys file configured correctly.
I tried setting
 PasswordAuthentication no
in sshd_config,
but it still asked for a password. Maybe I should try it with ssh_config
I also don't know if those files should be in .ssh/ or not.
