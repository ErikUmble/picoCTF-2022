Seeing that the website printed the SQL command, I knew this was an SQL injection challenge
my first try was just to set my username as:
admin'; TABLES
since I wanted to see the tables available,
which also gave me the flag, in a hidden html tag
By blocking the "AND WHERE password" section, the command did not care what was in the password field
