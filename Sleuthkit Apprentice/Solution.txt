I first downloaded and unziped the disk image with gunzip
then I tried 
	fls disk.flag.img
to look for the files on the disk, but it said it didn't 
recognize disk system. So I used
	mmls disk.flag.img
to see the disk structure, and there were 4 partitions, the first being unallocated.
I tried the first linux one with
	fls disk.flag.img -o 2048
which didn't have any interesting-looking files. I tried
	fls -r disk.flag.img -o 2048
for recursive search, but it didn't find anything else. So I then tried the next partition
	fls -r disk.flag.img -o 206848
but it was an unrecognized system. So I tried the last Linux partition with
	fls -r disk.flag.img -o 360448
this had many files, so I used 
	fls -r disk.flag.img -o 360448 | grep flag
to find two files with flag in their names. I tried opening the first with
	icat disk.flag.img -0 360448 2082
and then the second with 
	icat disk.flag.img -0 360448 2371
which had the flag:
