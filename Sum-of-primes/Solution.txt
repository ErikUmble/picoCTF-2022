A quick web search revealed this:
supposing 
b = p + q 
n = p*q
then 
(x-p)*(x-q) = x^2 -bx + n
the roots of which are p and q
so p = b/2 + sqrt((b^2 - 4*n))/2
and d = b/2 - sqrt((b^2 - 4*n))/2

Even easier,
φ(n)=(p−1)(q−1)=pq−p−q+1=pq−(p+q)+1=n−b+1

This didn't work, and I suspect it has to do with the fact that
gen.py uses d = pow(e, -1, m) where m = lcm(p-1, q-1) instead of phi= (p-1)*(q-1).
Nvm, that actually shouldn't matter.
It's just strange that the output does not correspond to ascii.

Oh, I realized my mistake, when selecting b to copy and past it from output.txt,
I accidently left off the first two digits. Now it works as expected using the 
totient.
