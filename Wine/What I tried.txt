I spent nearly 2 hours trying this one, unsucessfully. 
I know what needs to happen: since the vuln function uses get() with 
a 128 byte buffer, we can pass a longer string which will begin overwriting 
the memory beyond that buffer. Using gdb, I discovered the instruction address of the win function to be 0x00401530
so we need to overwrite the buffer up to the return address section of the stack,
and put the target address in that location so that after vuln executes, win will execute next.
By inputting a long string after "Give me a string!", we can see some debugging info,
stack trace, etc, which is probably necessary to solve the challenge, but 
I'm not sure how yet.
