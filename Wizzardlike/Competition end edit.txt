After reading a solution writeup, I realized the simple mistake I made in the floor_map_display.py.
Since the string lengths were all over 20000, I thought I should print rows of length 200, while the game
actually used row length of 100. This small change to the script now has it printing the correct floor maps
which contain the flag. But while I could make out picoCTF{ur_4_w1z4rd_1496299}, I think there needs to be one
more digit in the flag, but none of my tries have been successful. I tried increasing the number of rows printed
to 100, as the game would have, but this did not reveal any more than 30.
