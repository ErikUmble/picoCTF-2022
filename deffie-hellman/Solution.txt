I looked up a basic explanation of the deffie-hellman key exchange and used
p = 13
g = 5
a = 7
b = 3

to compute
A = (g**a)mod(p) = 8
B = (g**b)mod(p) = 8
and
s = (B**a)mod(p) = (A**b)mod(p) = 5
so the ceaser cipher shift is 5
I then simply used https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher
inputted the encrypted message, made sure to add 0123456789 to the alphabet,
and the result gave:

picoCTF{C4354R_C1PH3R_15_4_817_0U7D473D_5E3C2EE2}
