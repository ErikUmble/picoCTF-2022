I first decompressed the file with:
	upx -d unpackme-upx
and ran it with
	./unpackme-upx
seeing as it was taking an imput number and checking if it was the "favorite"
I knew I'd need to see some of the assembly to find what the number it was
being checked against was.
so I opened the debugger with
	gdb ./unpackme-upx

and used
	disass main
to dissasemble the main function.
just after a call to <__isoc99_scanf> I noticed the following instruction
	0x0000000000401ef8 <+133>:   cmp    eax,0xb83cb
so I guessed 0xb83cb must be the favorite number.
Running the program again, and entering 754635 as the number, I recieved
	picoCTF{up><_m3_f7w_e510a27f}
